# Targon

Easy to setup modulable crawler for Riot API.



Targon is a layer on top of [Pantheon](https://github.com/Canisback/pantheon) to abstract most of the tedious asyncio development. It offers a set of Callers, Queues and Parsers allowing to setup an efficient crawler while allowing to integrated custom code to use the data.

WARNING : Work Heavily on Progress.


## How to use

To install : 
```
pip install targon
```

As I am too lazy to write docs for now, it might just be better to simply use the template for matches.

Take a look a the [examples](http://github.com/Canisback/targon/examples).

Targon support [Solari](https://github.com/Canisback/solari) as an add-on. To use it, you have to install it separately (as in it is not installed when installing Targon).


## Roadmap

 * DOCS
 * More callers (ideally support all endpoints)
 * More templates
